# CodingCat-An-Online-Judge-
[This is still under development. The only verdict the online judge handles is matching the exact output(s). You will only get Accepted or Wrong answer.] 

A simple Online Judge Project developed using MYSQL, Php, JQuery, Bootstrap, Css and HTML

You will be needing XAMPP/MAMP(or any local server host) to run the files. For each compilers they are set to default environment (On Windows machine) N.B. this will not run on Linux machines. If you have installed the compilers in other locations change it inside the putenv() function.

The database named "codingcatdb" uses MYSQL (default username = "root" and password = ""). Add problems as you want using phpmyadmin as there's no admin panel in this version.
